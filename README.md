The provided code implements a question-answering system that combines machine learning with vector search for handling queries, particularly in the medical field. It uses the MedRAG/pubmed dataset, a collection of biomedical literature from PubMed, to provide relevant scientific context for answering questions. The dataset is filtered based on keywords related to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and processed into embeddings using a sentence transformer model. These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database, allowing for efficient semantic similarity search. When a query is made, relevant documents are retrieved from Pinecone, and a Meta-LLaMA language model hosted via Hugging Face generates an answer based on this retrieved information. The overall system integrates document retrieval with advanced natural language processing to deliver precise, context-aware responses to complex queries.
